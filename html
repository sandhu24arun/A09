		<h2>Movie Reviews</h2>
		<p>Lots of heat but not very much light. It came across as a kind of daytime soap operas versues showing the personalities of the players rather than dealing with the nuts and bolts of what really happened.</p>
		
		<p>I am watching the for the 3rd time, trying to understand how this large group of capitalist pigs could royalty screw their families, descandants, neighbors, countrymen and the rest of the world.</p>
